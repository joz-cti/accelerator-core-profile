              value: "<p class=\"lead\">This is an example of the 'lead' styling to make the first paragraph use larger text. At the moment this needs to be manually added to the first paragraph of the first <em>Rich text</em> component on each page using the 'Styles' dropdown in CKEditor (the WYSIWYG editor).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we have completed DERP-250 (the <em>Page section</em> component) then the ability to add page components will be moved into a <em>Page section</em> component that manages the H2 tags. When we have this setup, we can write some code that loops through all the Page section components, finds the first <em>Rich text</em> component in use on the page, then automatically makes the first paragraph use the 'lead' styling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any heading added via this component automatically gets an anchor link made for it. Here's an example that will <a href=\"#what-to-expect-from-here-on-out\">scroll you down to the next H3 element</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the remaining example content (below the horizontal rule) for this story comes from a <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/\">third-party code repo</a> and wasn't written by CTI or GLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you <em>really are</em> just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a <code>p</code> element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not awful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt to give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, <a href=\"https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md\">read the documentation</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>What to expect from here on out</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I could think of, like <strong>bold text</strong>, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, <em>and even italics</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>We want everything to look good out of the box.</li>\r\n\t<li>Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.</li>\r\n\t<li>Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we're going to try out another header style.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Typography should be easy</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>So that's a header for you — with any luck if we've done our job correctly that will look pretty reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something a wise person once told me about typography is:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Typography is pretty important if you don't want your stuff to look like trash. Make it good then it won't be bad.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It's probably important that images look okay here by default as well:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I'm going to show you an example of an unordered list to make sure that looks good, too:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>So here is the first item in this list.</li>\r\n\t<li>In this example we're keeping the items short.</li>\r\n\t<li>Later, we'll use longer, more complex list items.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And that's the end of this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if we stack headings?</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>We should make sure that looks good, too.</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes you have headings directly underneath each other. In those cases you often have to undo the top margin on the second heading because it usually looks better for the headings to be closer together than a paragraph followed by a heading should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When a heading comes after a paragraph…</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>I often do this thing where list items have headings.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. Pretty tough honestly, you could make a strong argument that you just shouldn't write this way.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Since this is a list, I need at least two items.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic. That's why I've added this second list item so I actually have something to look at when writing the styles.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After this sort of list I usually have a closing statement or paragraph, because it kinda looks weird jumping right to a heading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully, that looks good enough to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What about nested lists?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nested lists basically always look bad which is why editors like Medium don't even let you do it, but let's try making it work.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Here is the first ordered list item with an unordered list 'inside' it</strong>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Here's the first ordered list item</li>\r\n\t\t<li>And a second ordered list item</li>\r\n\t\t<li>And a third ordered list item</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Since we need to have more items, here's another one.</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>I'm not sure if we'll bother styling more than two levels deep.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Two is already too much, three is guaranteed to be a bad idea.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>If you nest four levels deep you belong in prison.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Two items isn't really a list, three is good though.</strong>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Again please don't nest lists if you want people to actually read your content.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Nobody wants to look at this.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>I'm upset that we even have to bother styling this.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The most annoying thing about lists in Markdown is that <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements aren't given a child <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag unless there are multiple paragraphs in the list item. That means I have to worry about styling that annoying situation too.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>For example, here's another nested list.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>But this time with a second paragraph.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>These list items won't have <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Because they are only one line each</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>But in this second top-level list item, they will.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>This is especially annoying because of the spacing on this paragraph.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>As you can see here, because I've added a second line, this list item now has a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>This is the second line I'm talking about by the way.</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>Finally here's another list item so it's more like a list.</p>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>A closing list item, but with no nested list, because why not?</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, a sentence to close off this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>There are other elements we need to style</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I almost forgot to mention links, like <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com\">this link to the Tailwind CSS website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We even included table styles, check it out:</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column header one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column header two</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column one</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column two</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row two, column one</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row two, column one</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row header one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column two</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column three</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row header two</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column two</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column three</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row header three</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column two</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Row one, column three</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column two</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row two</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Column two</th>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row one</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<th>Row two</th>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>Column xxx</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<caption>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H39\">caption</a> should be a short description of the table's purpose, e.g. 'Schedule for the week of 6 March'.
